# GPIO LAB 4

## Project Overview

- For this project, you should use GPIO module and two 7-segments display to implement two digits counter form 0 to 99. 
- PORTC4, PORTC5, PORTC6 and PORTC7 as output pins and connect to Binary-Coded Display.
- PORTC2 as an output pin to enable the first 7-segment.
- PORTC3 as an output pin to enable the second 7-segment.
- use multiplexing technique to switch between first 7-segment and the second one.

## Dependencies
- The microcontroller used for this project is atmega32 microcontroller.
- The IDE used for this project is eclipse and AVR Eclipse Plugin.
- The simulation tool for this porject is proteus 8 to simulation the atmega32 microcontroller.
